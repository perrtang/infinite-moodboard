Infinite Moodboard runs the canvas, imported media, transforms, exports, and version history in your browser. No account is required for local editing, saving, opening, or exporting. Sign-in is requested only when you choose Google Drive storage, Drive-native sharing, or other connected features.

## Start here

- **Recommended:** [open the web app](https://moodboard.petfashion.tw/). On first use, choose this device or Google Drive as that Moodboard's one primary storage location; a local recovery copy remains available in either mode.
- **Editable files:** download a `.moodboard` file from the app and reopen it in the online app at any time.
- **Self-hosting:** download the latest `self-hosted.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/perrtang/infinite-moodboard/releases/latest). It is a static web build, not a native desktop installer; follow the included `SELF_HOSTING.md` instead of double-clicking `index.html`.

## Highlights

- Infinite canvas with drag-and-drop or paste for images, video, and SVG.
- Text, common shapes, custom SVG, groups, grids, papers, rulers, guides, and print/social presets.
- Multi-selection, nine-point transform pivots, proportional group scaling, alignment, distribution, layers, markers, and filtering.
- Composition snapshots, local version history, `.moodboard` working files, and PNG, WebP, AVIF, PDF, asset, and read-only HTML output.
- Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English interfaces.
- Optional Google Drive file storage and Drive-native sharing with viewer/editor permissions on the same file.
- 3D, Drive sharing, and export runtimes are loaded only when used, keeping the opening bundle smaller.

## v0.54.5 — the same sharing flow for every recipient

[Read the complete v0.54.5 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.54.5.html)

- Restricted links are labeled explicitly. Copying a link never grants access; owners use the same link-view or invitation controls for every account.
- Recipients can open the exact file in Google Drive to check/request access, and viewers have a clear path to request editing. Read failures do not assume the account lacks permission.
- Resource keys survive initial metadata reads, version verification, downloads, and persisted links used when reopening a shared file.
- The development-only `?sharingPreview=denied` route shows five synthetic interface states without Google authorization or permission changes. It does not count as real cross-account acceptance.

## v0.54.4 — recover from a stalled shared-file Picker

[Read the complete v0.54.4 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.54.4.html)

- A failed or timed-out Picker is disposed so its blank overlay cannot hide the error and retry action.
- The development acceptance page checks Google's actual response to the current key and OAuth before opening Picker. `?keyCheck=1` checks only the key; it does not count as shared-file acceptance.

## v0.54.3 — shared-file Picker website verification

[Read the complete v0.54.3 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.54.3.html)

- Cross-origin requests send only the website origin, allowing Google Picker's website-restricted API key to verify the caller without disclosing share paths or query parameters.
- The deployment configuration check now rejects an incompatible document referrer policy. Key-format checks alone do not establish live Google acceptance.
- `scripts/drive-picker-acceptance.html` opens the exact shared file with real OAuth and reads its contents and current-account access without writing a board or changing permissions. Use the approved local origin `http://localhost:5000`; `?policy=baseline` reproduces the earlier policy for comparison.

## v0.54.2 — browser-compatible conditional Drive updates

[Read the complete v0.54.2 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.54.2.html)

- Existing files use a JSON ETag and conditional update on the same Drive API version, avoiding the unavailable v3 response header while retaining conflict protection.
- Uploads use Google's multipart/related format, preserve the file link and private properties, and verify the saved version after upload.
- Shared-file resource keys accompany updates, and remote renames cannot silently be replaced by an old local name.
- Generic browser storage errors no longer claim that disk space is full.
- The development-only `scripts/drive-cloud-acceptance.html` exercises a dedicated synthetic file with real OAuth: create, repeated save, stale multipart rejection, content readback and retained revisions. It is not part of the production app bundle. Use an OAuth-approved local origin, such as `http://localhost:5000` for this project.

## v0.54.1 — clear cloud-update outcomes

[Read the complete v0.54.1 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.54.1.html)

- Updating current work shows preparation and upload/verification progress. Confirmed success closes the dialog and announces completion.
- Repeated version conflicts and failed uploads keep an actionable inline explanation instead of silently resetting the button. Expired authorization has one reconnect path without overlapping dialogs.
- Missing safety metadata stops the update with a specific reason. Failed post-write verification is reported as an uncertain result, not as proof that nothing was uploaded.
- A local recovery failure remains visible alongside any cloud error, with a backup route. Failure cleanup is time-bounded and cannot enable another action before it settles; narrow-screen actions stack without squeezing labels.
- Existing canvas, file identity, conditional-write checks and revision recovery remain intact. The browser test script covers success, retries and failure states with mock Drive; real account acceptance remains separate.

## v0.54.0 — explicit saving and recoverable cloud loading

[Read the complete v0.54.0 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.54.0.html)

- The labeled top-left action is **Save** for local files and **Update to cloud** for Drive documents. Both preserve the current canvas; cloud saving only uploads.
- Cloud content differences prompt an explicit load choice. Loading first creates a pinned recovery checkpoint, with a restore action that survives refresh and pauses automatic uploads.
- Downloading a local copy does not change the primary destination. Switching to local opens an independent document and preserves the original Drive file and share link.
- Stale reads and cross-tab updates cannot replace the active canvas. Conflicting saves use one target-bound confirmation.
- Isolated browser acceptance: `NODE_PATH=<directory containing playwright> node scripts/test-storage-workflow.cjs` against the local Vite service. It blocks external requests and mocks Drive; real account integration requires separate acceptance.

## v0.53.0 — direct layers and safer Drive decisions release

[Read the complete v0.53.0 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.53.0.html)

- Uses the full layer row for selection and drag ordering, removing the narrow grip and its stray focus line.
- Adds Shift range selection, Command/Ctrl discontiguous selection, and ordered batch movement for selected layers.
- Shows only two safe Drive-conflict choices first; defer is secondary and overwrite stays behind an advanced disclosure plus confirmation.
- Rejects malformed Picker credentials before opening Google and verifies production credential format before deployment.

## v0.52.0 — large-board Drive sync recovery release

[Read the complete v0.52.0 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.52.0.html)

- Continues Google Drive upload when the browser cannot update its local recovery copy, while clearly warning that the cloud and local outcomes differ.
- Stores each current board once instead of duplicating the full payload in legacy state and routine sync-queue records.
- Compacts safe legacy and queued copies before retrying a failed local save, without deleting a newer queued snapshot.
- Separates sync-queue bookkeeping errors from local recovery failures and retries queue cleanup after a confirmed Drive upload.
- Prevents a stale queue entry from leaving a successfully uploaded board labelled as still syncing.

## v0.51.0 — continuous Drive onboarding release

[Read the complete v0.51.0 release notes.](./public/release-notes/v0.51.0.html)

- Turns the Google Drive storage choice into one explicit flow: disclosure, PETFASHION sign-in, and least-privilege `drive.file` authorization without a second Connect action.
- Commits Drive as the primary location only after the connection is verified; failures and cancellation retain the previous target and local recovery copy.
- Automatically closes My Moodboards and returns to the workspace after successful connection or conflict resolution.
- Keeps connection separate from upload: no Drive project file is created until the first explicit save.
- Removes double-click deletion from guides; deletion remains an explicit right-click, layer, or keyboard action.
- Keeps an existing guide fixed on pointer-down, preserves the grab offset during a real drag, and publishes a required per-version release-notes file from now on.

## v0.50.0 — Drive recovery and quiet update release

- Preserves each board's Google Drive link across app updates while restoring OAuth authorization safely after sign-in or refresh.
- Always ends the active sync state after authorization, local recovery, upload, or queue failures, so the interface cannot remain stuck on “syncing”.
- Recovers interrupted queued sync jobs after a page reload and automatically retries only temporary network or service failures.
- Pauses the app-update notice whenever a work dialog is open, with a clearer title, readable explanation, and consistently sized actions.

## v0.49.0 — safe shared-file opening release

- Opens a recipient's first Drive share through Google Picker while preserving the least-privilege `drive.file` scope.
- Verifies that the selected Drive file ID exactly matches the shared link before reading or linking any Moodboard content.
- Keeps cancellation, mismatched selection, missing Drive permission, and unavailable Picker configuration in an explicit recovery state instead of showing a blank board as the shared file.
- Loads the Picker only when needed and retains the optional Drive resource key throughout selection and download.

## v0.48.0 — Drive-native sharing release

- Makes the user's own Google Drive `.moodboard` file the only cloud sharing unit; Infinite Moodboard no longer creates or resumes a Firestore sharing room.
- Uses Google Drive permissions for restricted access, link-view access, invited viewers/editors, role changes, and removal.
- Copies an exact app link containing the Drive file ID and optional resource key while keeping Drive—not the URL—as the permission authority.
- Opens shared files read-only when Drive denies editing, preserves a local recovery copy, and clearly migrates legacy `?collab=` links without writing new Firestore data.

## v0.47.0 — direct sharing access release

- Opens File → Share and collaborate into a link-first panel that automatically prepares or safely resumes the current Moodboard's share link after sign-in.
- Keeps general link access signed-in and view-only, while owners can see every member and update each person's Viewer or Editor role directly.
- Preserves owner-approved edit requests, clear retry and new-link recovery paths, and the separation between collaboration links and Google Drive storage.
- Guards asynchronous link creation and resume against switching to a different Moodboard, with desktop and mobile permission controls plus full built-in localization.

## v0.46.0 — focused collaboration and alignment release

- Provides a dedicated link for the current Moodboard instead of treating the app homepage as a file link; verified coworkers enter as viewers and request edit access from the owner.
- Adds smart edge/center alignment while moving objects, plus Option/Alt distance readouts to adjacent objects.
- Makes Guides and Object layers independently collapsible, with Guides collapsed by default and Object layers open.
- Adds configurable dot/grid colors and opacity while keeping the background aligned with the ruler unit, origin, pan, and zoom.
- Uses native zoom-in/zoom-out cursors for Zoom Area and prevents Space from repeatedly toggling a focused zoom percentage control.

## v0.45.0 — ruler-aligned workspace release

- Aligns canvas dots and grid lines with the active ruler unit, origin, pan, and zoom instead of using unrelated fixed pixel spacing.
- Uses matching major/minor ruler divisions so the background remains a meaningful measurement aid at every supported zoom level.
- Centers the ruler intersection control within the complete ruler composition.
- Verifies the public stable-version manifest after every GitHub Pages deployment, preventing an older deployed feed from being reported as current.

## v0.44.0 — guide layers release

- Adds a dedicated Guides section above ordinary object layers, matching the rule that every visible workspace element must remain discoverable in Layers.
- Supports guide multi-selection, semantic guide groups, same-axis batch movement, batch locking, ungrouping, and batch deletion without mixing guides into object transforms or exports.
- Makes global and per-guide locks remove guides from selection while keeping explicit unlock and management actions available.
- Preserves guide groups in `.moodboard` files and realtime collaboration, migrates older boards safely, and keeps guide selection separate from object selection.

## v0.43.0 — workspace precision release

- Makes Shift-dragged guides visibly magnetic in px and mm by adapting to perceptible integer ruler marks at the current zoom; cm and inch retain integer-unit snapping.
- Keeps only the centered Moodboard filename as visible Header text while preserving accessible tooltips and live Drive status.
- Reorganizes the primary toolbar with icon-only creation tools, Zoom Area beside Hand, Option/Alt inverse zooming, and plain minus/plus zoom steps.
- Restores an already granted Google Drive session silently after refresh for the same signed-in PETFASHION account without persisting OAuth access tokens.

## v0.42.0 — Zoom Window release

- Adds a one-shot Zoom Window tool beside the desktop zoom controls and inside the mobile More menu.
- Drag over blank canvas or objects to fit that region in the viewport without changing the Moodboard, history, or autosave state.
- Restores the previous tool after zooming or pressing Escape, while Space retains temporary Hand priority.
- Keeps small selection labels out of the way and preserves keyboard-only focus outlines for Tab navigation.

## v0.41.0 — safe Drive conflict recovery release

- Stops treating Drive revision-retention metadata updates as newer content.
- Keeps auto-sync paused while a local/Drive conflict remains unresolved and shows one readable recovery panel.
- Adds a confirmed overwrite path bound to the reviewed Moodboard, Drive file, and remote version, while retaining a recoverable Drive revision.
- Keeps save-as-copy independent from the current Drive link and sync queue, and preserves actionable failure details until the conflict is resolved.

## v0.40.0 — quiet temporary-Hand release

- Keeps the selected Select or Hand tool visually unchanged while Space temporarily pans the workspace.
- Removes pointer-created focus outlines from primary canvas tools while retaining keyboard focus for Tab navigation.
- Lets Space keep its native activation behavior when an actionable control has keyboard focus.

## v0.39.0 — immersive source-view release

- Replaces the central Moodboard editing surface with a dedicated Source workspace while inspecting imported media.
- Adds source-only pan, wheel zoom, 100%, and fit-to-window controls without mutating the Moodboard viewport.
- Hides canvas tools, rulers, objects, status HUD, and export controls in Source mode, then restores the exact Moodboard view on return.
- Keeps desktop and mobile controls touch-accessible and preserves source navigation, search, metadata, and original-file actions.

## v0.38.0 — movable ruler-origin release

- Drag the ruler intersection to redefine the shared zero point without moving objects or guides.
- Recalculate ruler ticks, guide readouts, and Shift snapping relative to the new origin.
- Save and synchronize the origin in `.moodboard` files while keeping ruler visibility and units device-local.

## v0.37.0 — temporary Hand tool release

- Hold Space from any canvas tool to temporarily activate Hand and pan from blank canvas or over an object.
- Restore the prior tool immediately on keyup or window blur, while changing only the canvas cursor and behavior—not the selected toolbar control.
- Leave Space untouched inside native fields, contenteditable text, and custom textbox widgets.

## v0.36.0 — global Color Set release

- Adds named device-global Color Sets shared by text, shape fills, and paper colors across every Moodboard.
- Keeps a protected built-in palette while supporting custom set creation, rename, color removal, and confirmed deletion.
- Imports and exports portable `.moodcolors` v2 files, appends collision-safe copies, and migrates legacy v1 color libraries without losing custom colors.
- Adds responsive Inspector management, keyboard-visible focus states, and Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English interface copy.

## v0.35.0 — guide control release

- Keeps the guide position readout fully visible while dragging and shows when Shift snapping is active.
- Snaps guides to integer marks in the selected ruler unit, including when Shift is pressed after dragging begins.
- Adds persistent all-guide locking in File plus per-guide right-click lock, unlock, and explicit delete actions.
- Synchronizes global and individual guide locks in shared boards and removes the unexplained canvas-origin corner artifact.

## v0.34.0 — explicit file workflow release

- Consolidates open, save, save-as, browser HTML, output, sharing, versions, and about actions in one File menu.
- Asks local-first users to choose a `.moodboard` destination through Finder or the system file picker, then autosaves to that file while retaining a browser recovery copy.
- Shows Google Drive sync state beside Undo and Redo only when Drive is the current Moodboard's primary location.
- Keeps papers independent from nearby objects, allows repeated paper insertion, and removes the misleading padding guide.
- Rejects stale file-picker results after board or storage-target changes and immediately persists newly opened files for recovery.

## v0.33.0 — collision-free canvas HUD release

- Places the lower-left status group and lower-right export controls in one shared responsive HUD row.
- Offsets the status group from the visible ruler while preserving ruler drag interactions.
- Truncates secondary status details before controls can overlap and keeps the mobile app-version treatment intact.

## v0.32.0 — source workspace isolation release

- Turns Sources into an independent workspace with source-specific tools, details, original-file download, and visible-instance locating.
- Prevents pointer, keyboard, paste, drop, Inspector, export, history, and title edits from changing hidden Moodboard objects while inspecting sources.
- Creates clean independent canvas instances at their original dimensions and restores the previous Moodboard selection when returning.
- Adds Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English copy for the complete source workflow.

## v0.31.0 — link-first sharing release

- Adds one clear Share action that creates a link for the current Moodboard.
- Opens a shared link automatically after verified sign-in, with view-only access by default and an explicit request-to-edit flow.
- Keeps collaboration sharing separate from Google Drive storage and explains that boundary in the interface.
- Restricts bearer invites to viewer access and prevents an owner from creating another owner through the collaboration API.

## v0.30.0 — storage destination release

- Gives every Moodboard one clear primary storage location: this device or Google Drive.
- Keeps IndexedDB as a local recovery copy even when primary autosave is disabled or Drive is selected.
- Combines local records and app-accessible Drive files in My Moodboards, with local-change, sync, conflict, quota, offline, and authorization states.
- Consolidates the top bar to My Moodboards and one destination-aware Save action; portable files are explicitly downloaded as `.moodboard` backups.

## v0.29.0 — intrinsic image sizing release

- Keeps an imported image or SVG at its intrinsic pixel dimensions instead of silently shrinking its longest edge to 420px.
- Stores the actual intrinsic dimensions for reliable one-click original-size recovery.
- Keeps width and height input drafts stable while typing, applies once on Enter or blur, and restores the current value with Escape.

## v0.28.0 — branded authentication release

- Moves Google and Email verification handlers to `auth.petfashion.tw` so the sign-in flow stays visibly within PETFASHION.
- Keeps the previous Firebase callback available for existing PETFASHION services while adding the branded OAuth callback.
- Verifies the branded authentication domain as part of the release test suite.

## v0.27.0 — PETFASHION custom-domain release

- Publishes the install-free GitHub Pages app at `moodboard.petfashion.tw`.
- Builds Pages from the domain root while preserving the portable relative-path self-hosted ZIP.
- Keeps the previous GitHub Pages URL as GitHub's managed redirect and retains versioned rollback tags and external backups.

## v0.26.0 — GitHub distribution release

- Publishes the current app through tested GitHub Pages and a versioned GitHub Release.
- Adds a reproducible self-hosted ZIP and SHA-256 checksum for every release tag.
- Reworks this README around a direct online-app path, clear privacy boundaries, searchable product language, and multilingual orientation.
- Prevents this standalone repository from deploying a partial Firestore rule file over PETFASHION's central production rules.

## Privacy and connected features

- Imported content, local autosaves, and local versions live in the current browser's IndexedDB by default.
- Signing in does **not** upload a Moodboard.
- Google Drive requires a separate `drive.file` consent and only creates a remote file after the user actively saves.
- Sharing never creates a second cloud workspace: content, versions, and member permissions remain attached to the same file in the user's own Google Drive.
- Drive tokens remain in the current tab memory and are not written to IndexedDB or `localStorage`.
- Marketing consent is separate from account creation.

Read the complete [public beta data notice](PRIVACY.md) and [security policy](SECURITY.md) before enabling connected features on a fork.

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 22 or a compatible runtime.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Verification:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

Create the self-hosted release asset:

```bash
npm run release:package -- 0.30.0
```

Google Drive uses the least-privilege `drive.file` scope. A fork must supply its own OAuth client and approved origins:

```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your-web-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
VITE_GOOGLE_DRIVE_PICKER_API_KEY=your-restricted-browser-api-key
VITE_GOOGLE_DRIVE_PROJECT_NUMBER=your-google-cloud-project-number
```

The Picker key must be restricted to the deployed and local development origins plus `https://docs.google.com/*`, and to both the Google Picker API and Google Drive API. A link-viewable file can be opened anonymously in a separate read-only viewer; the public key retrieves only the linked file and its resource key, and the viewer does not replace local workspace data. Restricted files require account authorization. For editing, the signed-in app attempts to open the exact file, but Google may still require file-specific authorization through Picker; the app validates the selection before loading it. Real two-account authorization and resource-key behavior must be verified independently before release.

### Legacy Firestore sources

Older releases used a separate Firestore sharing-room prototype. The current production app does not import or use that runtime; the remaining legacy source and rule fragment are retained only for migration review and must never be deployed from this repository.

## Release and recovery

- A push to `main` runs tests and a production build before GitHub Pages deployment.
- A `vX.Y.Z` tag runs tests again and creates a GitHub Release with a self-hosted ZIP and checksum.
- Every accepted milestone also has a `backup/vX.Y.Z` Git tag plus an external, verified source snapshot that remains recoverable even when macOS has offloaded older Git objects.
- See [SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md) for the downloaded web build and [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the maintainer checklist.
